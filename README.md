# Firebase Realtime Database

The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronised in realtime to every connected client.

To add Firebase to your JavaScript project, the setup guide can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#add-sdk-and-initialize).

To run this project you will need a Google Service Account key. You can follow this guide on how to obtain it [here](https://clemfournier.medium.com/how-to-get-my-firebase-service-account-key-file-f0ec97a21620).
